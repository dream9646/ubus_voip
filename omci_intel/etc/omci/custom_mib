# custom omci mib
#
# values defined in this file will override the one defined in xml/xdb files
# and become the default config value before an me is created
# so if me is inited in call back routines (meinfo_cb.create or meinfo_hw.create),
# then the callback value will override the value in this file 
#
# ps: the data type of the value will auto detected through the attr definition,
#     so no " or ' is required for strings
#
# ps: multiple lines for same key could be defined, 
#     the later would override the previous one
#

# Version (14byte,string,R)
