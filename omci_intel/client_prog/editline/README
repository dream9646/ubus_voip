editline
========

This is a line editing library.  It can be linked into almost any program to
provide command-line editing and history.  It is call-compatible with the FSF
readline library, but is a fraction of the size (and offers fewer features).

The editline library was created by Simmule Turner and Rich Salz back in 1992.
At the time they chose to distribute the code under a "C News-like" copyright,
see the file LICENSE for details.

The small size (<30k), lack of dependencies (no ncurses needed!) and the free
license should make this library interesting to many embedded developers.

Configuration is made by supplying different options to the GNU configure
script.  In the `examples/` directory you can find some small code snippets used
for testing.

This version of the editline library is a fork off the Minix3 sources. Other
know versions, often based off of the original comp.sources.unix posting are:

* Debian [libeditline](http://packages.qa.debian.org/e/editline.html)
* [Heimdal](http://www.h5l.org)
* [Festival speech-tools](http://festvox.org/festival/)
* Steve Tell's [editline patches](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~tell/dist.html)

The most intersting patches and bug fixes from each fork have been merged here.
Outstanding issues are listed in the TODO file.

An explanation of the version numbering may be in order.  I didn't know about
the Debian version for quite some time, so I kept a different name for the
package and a different versioning scheme.  In June 2009, I decided to line up
alongside Debian, with the intent of merging the efforts.
